    <h3>What is sancocho?</h3>
    <p>
        Sancocho is a satisfying stew with humble origins. 
        Every country has their own version of stew.
        They would make a huge pot and let it stew all day and have 
        a hearty meal ready after a long day of labor.Variations of sancocho can be found 
        throughout the Spanish Caribbean and Latin America.<br>
        Traditionally in the <em>Dominican Republic</em>, sancocho is made with a variety of
        meats: pork, chicken, beef, goat. For simplicity, 
        I use only one meat. I love it particularly with 
        pork and use three different meat cuts for added 
        flavor but chicken and beef are all great to use in this recipe as well

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mash garlic, oregano, and 1 teaspoon salt together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Douse chicken, beef, and pork with lemon juice in a large bowl. Drain half the liquid. Mix the mashed garlic, half of the onions, 
            2 tablespoons vegetable oil, and vinegar into the meat mixture.</li>
            <li>Heat the remaining 1/2 cup vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the meat 
            mixture in batches and cook until browned on all sides, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer the browned meats into a large pot. Add half of the water, chicken broth, beef consomme, 2 bouillon cubes, and 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer, 
            covered, until meats are more than halfway cooked through, about 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine pumpkin, sweet potatoes, eddeos, yuca, potatoes, plantains, corn, celery, carrots, green pepper, cilantro, and adobo seasoning in the simmering pot. Return soup to a boil. Reduce heat to low and continue simmering until the sancocho is thick and the root vegetables are soft, 1 to 2 hours. Stir in the remaining
            half of the water by gradual increments to replace any evaporated liquid.</li>
        </ol>
